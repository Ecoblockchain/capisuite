[Unit]
Description=capi suite (answering machine)

# In real life, this unit needs to be started after the capi implementation has started, but this is wildly different
# between installations.
# In my case, it is:
# After=network.target mISDNcapid.service
# See https://gist.github.com/larsimmisch/62bb9affe6032eeb7a687f6870c10416 for an example of the mISDNcapid service definition

After=network.target 

[Service]
ExecStart=@sbindir@/capisuite
