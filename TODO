NICE:
- ?valgrind-clean the used libs and Python?
- support more than one send_controller
- don't use 34xx codes, define constants instead and print meaningful messages

FUTURE PLANS:
- setuid away from root (problem: chown of recorded file to user)
- test-implement the whole application part in Python
- rewrite capisuitefax and idle.py to use named socket communication
