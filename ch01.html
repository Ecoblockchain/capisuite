				for accessing your ISDN-hardware, you'll need a card for which a CAPI compatible
				driver is available.</p><p>Currently these are all cards manufactured by AVM and some Eicon cards.
				If you have one of the passive cards of AVM, you'll have to download and
				install their CAPI drivers.</p><p>With the upcoming Linux 2.6 and the new mISDN project included therein,
				also most cards which are supported by the HiSax driver today will soon have
				a CAPI-compliant driver. Unfortunately, mISDN also won't include a fax protocol
				implementation and therefore passive cards still won't be able to fax in <span class="application">CapiSuite</span>
				(or in any other program under Linux); fax support for passive cards is only
				available in the binary drivers from AVM currently.</p><p>There's no way to get <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> to work with the old ISDN4Linux interface
				and drivers. Presumable there also never will be one because of the mISDN project
				which will replace HiSax/ISDN4Linux soon.</p><p>There are some distributions (e.g. current versions of SUSE) which
				include the Capi4Linux drivers from AVM already - you'll only have to
				activate them (use YaST2 in SUSE Linux). If you own an active card of AVM
				(e.g. the B1, C2 or C4), then you'll have everything you need already installed.
				SuSE also provides a small frontend to configure <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> in YaST.</p><p><span class="application">CapiSuite</span> has mainly been tested on AVM ISDN cards, esp. the Fritz!PCI, the Fritz!USB and
				the B1 on the i386 platform but there should be no problem with other
				CAPI-compatible drivers for other cards or on other platforms. Nevertheless,
				some features aren't mandatory for all CAPI-compatible cards, so perhaps
				you may not be able to fax or to switch from voice to fax mode with all
				cards.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="require_soft"></a>Software</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="application">CapiSuite</span> depends on some packages which must be installed before <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> can be used.</p><p>I will list them here with a short information why these packages are needed and where to
				find further information on how to install them. It may be always a good idea to check the
				installation tool of your favourite distribution first and see if they're included with it before
				trying to download and install them from the net. Don't be afraid, because there are so many -
				most of them are included in nearly every distribution and perhaps are already installed on your system.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Python &gt;= 2.2</span></dt><dd><p><span class="application">CapiSuite</span> uses an embedded Python interpreter to interpret the given scripts -

							voice files used for calls on your machine. It's also required if you want to
							use the default scripts of <span class="application">CapiSuite</span>. I'll bet this is included in your distribution
							and most likely already installed on your system. Just try to start <span class="command"><strong>sox</strong></span>
							to get sure. As Helmut Gruber pointed out, you need at least version 12.17.3, as this

						color faxes. Unfortunately, there's currently no way to disable the reception of color faxes with
						AVM cards due to a bug in the AVM CAPI driver. So if someone sends you a color fax (which seems to
						be a very rare case), you'll need this package - unless you'll get a mail stating this error.

						<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pdflib.com/products/more/jpeg2ps.html" target="_top">http://www.pdflib.com/products/more/jpeg2ps.html</a>.</p><p>As the color fax protocol uses concatenated JPEG files for transferring multiple pages, you

							faxes, you'll need installed glibc locales because <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> needs to convert your fax
							headline to the historic CP437 encoding which AVM drivers expect. The glibc locales are
							a part of the default C library glibc which you definitely already have installed, but some
							distributors make the locales installable separately. SuSE e.g. puts them in a package 
							called glibc-locale which you probably have to install. To see if you already have them,
							look for a file called "IBM437.so" in your library paths (in SuSE it's located in 
							/usr/lib/gconv). If you don't find it, look for sub-packages of glibc which could include

			If you installed from sources, you should save your configuration
			files before doing <span class="command"><strong>make install</strong></span>. As this is
			done like for any other software package you use, we won't go into
			further detail about that here.</p><p>What this section should mainly cover are the changes in the 
			configuration files and requirements to other tools between different 
			versions, so that you'll be able to update your configuration quickly. 
			For a more complete list of new features and important changes, please 
			refer to the file <code class="filename">NEWS</code> distributed with the 
			CapiSuite packages. In addition, all single changes in the different 
			source code files can be found in the <code class="filename">ChangeLog</code>, 
			which, however, will only be interesting for developers, I suppose.</p><div class="sect3" title="From 0.4.4 to 0.4.5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="install_update_0_4_5"></a>From 0.4.4 to 0.4.5</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>default scripts</em></span> now use
				an SMTP connection to localhost instead of calling the 
				<span class="command"><strong>sendmail</strong></span> command manually as previous
				versions did. This was changed because the other mechanism
				had many stability problems in the past. This means, you now
				have to have a running SMTP daemon listening on your localhost.
				As this is the default configuration of most distributions, 
				this should be no problem.</p><p>In <code class="filename">answering_machine.conf</code> and 
				<code class="filename">fax.conf</code>, two new options have been added:
				<code class="option">fax_email_from</code> and <code class="option">voice_email_from</code>
