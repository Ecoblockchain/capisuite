			      CapiSuite

CapiSuite is an ISDN telecommunication suite providing easy to use
telecommunication functions which can be controlled from Python
scripts. Currently, mainly voice functions and fax sending/receiving
are supported.

It uses a CAPI-compatible driver for accessing the ISDN-hardware, so
you'll need an Eicon or AVM card with the according driver.

CapiSuite is distributed with scripts providing a multi-user answering
machine with automatic fax recognition, remote inquiry and fax
send/receive functions.

For further information, please have a look at the manual section
available online or in the download packages. Please test it and post
your feedback to the bug tracker and/or the mailing lists. Thank you!

For the documentation see the created HTML documents situated in
docs/manual/index.html or in the installed version see
$PREFIX/share/doc/capisuite/manual/index.html. There's also a german
translation of the manual available at http://www.capisuite.de/.
