		It uses the new CAPI interface for accessing
		your ISDN-hardware - so you'll need a card for which a CAPI compatible
		driver is available. Currently these are all cards manufactured by AVM
		and some Eicon cards.
		</p><p><span class="application">CapiSuite</span> tries to give the user the ability to code his own ISDN applications
		without having to fiddle around with all the dirty programming details like callback
		functions, data buffers, protocol settings and so on.</p><p>I took a scripting language which is (in my opinion) very easy to understand,
		to use and to learn - especially for beginners: Python. I extended it with some
		functions providing the basic ISDN "building blocks" for the users application.
		Behind these functions the heart of <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> implements all the dirty details
		a user isn't interested in. My goal was to make script-coding as
		simple as possible but to also give you the flexibility to realize what you
		want.</p><p>To give you an impression, coding a simple answering machine is as easy as:

		</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">def callIncoming (call, service, call_from, call_to):
    connect_voice (call, 10)            # answer call after 10 secs
    audio_send (call, "announcemnt.la") # play announcement
    audio_send (call, "beep.la")        # play beep
    audio_receive (call, "call.la", 10) # record call</pre></div><p>
		</p><p>Of course some details are missing like creating a unique filename or storing
		the additional information (called and calling party numbers, time, ...) - but I assume
		you got my idea.</p><p>And - don't be afraid - if you just want to have a normal answering machine or send and
		receive some fax documents, you can use the default scripts distributed with <span class="application">CapiSuite</span>.
		They give you already some nice features - e.g. the answering machine is multi-user
		ready, supports automatic fax detection and remote inquiry functions. You'll only
		need to tell <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> some details like your own number, record an own announcement
		and that's it.</p><p>So <span class="application">CapiSuite</span> is already equipped for your daily telecommunication needs - but if you don't
		like to do the things the way I do - just change it or completely do it on your
		own. And if you write nice scripts or have changes to my default scripts, I would
		love to get and perhaps make them available for all users if you don't mind.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pr01.html#welcome">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pr01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Structure of the manual</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
